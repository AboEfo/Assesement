# Transfinder-Assesment-Dawit
## Assessment Instructions

The goal of this assessment is to guage your ability to take existing code, and build a simple CI/CD system that deploys the provided asp.net 6 website.  While this is meant to be open-ended, if you would prefer to have Transfinder provide an AWS instance to deploy into/configure we will that up.

## Objective: Configure a CI/CD system to build the provided asp.net 6 source code and deploy it to a publically accessible location.

> Use whatever technologies you would like to accomplish the objective.
> The website does not need a friendly DNS name (IP is acceptable).

Bonus Goals:

1. The site is taking an average of 5+ seconds to load.  Can you identify how to improve the load time?
2. Containerize the application and deploy it via container.  If you prefer not to deploy the container, please provide a link to the containerized solution along with instructions for running it.
